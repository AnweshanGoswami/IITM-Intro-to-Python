    "A test match happened between Team A and Team B. The scores of the teams in both the innings are given as input in eight lines in the format given below. The first two lines represent the scores of Team A in the first innings and the next two lines represent the scores of Team A in the second innings. Likewise, the last four lines represent the scores of Team B in both the innings.\n",
