    "Accept a point in 2D space as input and find the region in space that this point belongs to. A point could belong to one of the four quadrants, or it could be on one of the two axes, or it could be the origin. The input is given in 2 lines: the first line is the x-coordinate of the point while the second line is its y-coordinate. The possible outputs are first, second, third, fourth, x-axis, y-axis, and origin. Any other output will not be accepted. Note that all outputs should be in lower case."
