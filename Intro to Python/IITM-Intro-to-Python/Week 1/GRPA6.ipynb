    "Accept two positive integers M and N as input. There are two cases to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) If M < N, then print M as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) If M >= N, subtract N from M. Call the difference M1. If M1 >= N, then subtract N from M1 and call the difference M2. Keep doing this operation until you reach a value k, such that, Mk < N. You have to print the value of Mk as output. You should be able to solve this problem using the concepts covered in week-1."
